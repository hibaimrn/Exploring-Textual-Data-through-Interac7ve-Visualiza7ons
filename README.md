# Project Title: Exploring Textual Data through Interactive Visualizations


## Datasets:
Students have the option to choose from two rich text datasets:
1. Enron Email Dataset
2. Cornell Movie Dialogs Dataset

## Requirements:
### 1. Data Exploration:
- Utilize Python and libraries like NLTK for basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the chosen dataset.

### 2. Web Integration:
- Implement a backend using Flask or Django to transfer processed data from Python to the web interface.

### 3. Interactive Visualizations:
- Develop a web-based interface using D3.js hosting a minimum of two sophisticated visualizations.
    - Visualizations should avoid standard charts and focus on more sophisticated options.
    - Must be fully interactive with basic functionality like highlighting, selection, zooming, etc.
    - One visualization must be based on graphs or trees.
    - Implement visualizations in the Focus+Context style for enhanced user understanding.

### 4. Brushing and Linking (Dashboarding):
- Implement brushing and linking functionalities between visualizations to enhance user interaction and exploration.

## Guidance:
- Provide clear documentation on NLP techniques, especially using libraries like NLTK in Python.
- Encourage creativity in designing visualizations to effectively convey specific details.
- Emphasize interactivity and Focus+Context design principles for user-friendly visualizations.

**Note:** This project encourages students to explore NLP, delve into the chosen dataset, and showcase skills in data processing and interactive visualization development. It aims to foster a holistic understanding of text data analysis and visualization techniques.
